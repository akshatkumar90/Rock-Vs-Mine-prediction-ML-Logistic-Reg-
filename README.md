Get Sonar data and perform Rock Vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression


ðŸš€ Rock vs. Mine Prediction Project Showcase ðŸš¢

I'm thrilled to share a project I recently worked on - a Rock vs. Mine prediction model using Machine Learning! ðŸŒŠðŸ¤–

1. Project Overview:

Developed a predictive model to classify sonar data as either a Rock (R) or a Mine (M) using Logistic Regression.
The dataset consisted of 208 samples with 60 features each.
Achieved an accuracy of approximately 83.4% on the training set.
2. Data Processing:

Explored and visualized the data using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Handled missing values and performed statistical analysis to understand the dataset better.
Utilized a count plot to visualize the distribution of Rock (R) and Mine (M) labels.
3. Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split method.
Employed Logistic Regression for model training, reaching an accuracy of 83.4% on the training data.
4. Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model accuracy on the training set and compared predictions with actual values.
The model showcased robust performance, correctly predicting Rock and Mine instances in the test set.
5. Making Predictions:

Demonstrated how the model can make predictions on new data, showcasing its practical application.
6. Conclusion:

This project highlights the power of machine learning in classifying sonar data, offering insights into its potential use in various real-world scenarios.
